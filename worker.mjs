// The home worker. Runs on the Mac mini; talks only outbound.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The Google Maps scan has to come from a residential IP —
// Google answers a datacenter profile with a thinner result page rather than an
// error, so a scan run in the Railway container is quietly incomplete. The mini
// is on a home line and is always on. It has no public address, so it dials the
// lab rather than the lab dialling it.
//
// THE LOOP IS THE WHOLE PROGRAM:
//
//   GET /api/jobs/next?worker=…   held open ~25s
//     204  -> ask again immediately
//     200  -> run the handler, POST the result, ask again
//     err  -> wait (backing off to 60s), ask again — never exit
//
//   POST /api/jobs/heartbeat        every 30s, but only while a job is running
//     The loop above is silent for as long as the handler takes, and a deep
//     research round takes minutes. See beat().
//
// A gmap.scan holds the loop for minutes while it runs; that is intended. One
// machine, one scan at a time, is what a residential line can do without
// looking like something other than a person.
//
// It never exits on purpose. A worker that quits on a network blip is a worker
// that is offline until someone notices, and the whole point of this machine is
// that nobody is watching it.
//
// Usage:
//   LAB_TOKEN=… node worker/macmini.mjs
// or put LAB_TOKEN in ~/.gmap-worker.env and just run it. See worker/README.md.

 * LANES. One claim loop per lane, running side by side in this one process.
 *
 * A single loop was right while the only job was a scan. It stops being right
 * the moment a 15-second ChatGPT call can end up queued behind a 60-second Maps
 * scan: the caller of the first is an HTTP request somebody is waiting on, and
 * the second holds the loop for minutes by design.
 *
 * The split is by duration, not by engine. `scan` is the slow residential-line
 * work that must stay one-at-a-time — that is what a home connection can do
 * without looking like something other than a person. `ask` is everything that
 * answers in seconds. Each lane is serial within itself, which is also what
 * keeps one Chrome per profile true for ChatGPT without any lock of our own.
 *
 * Each lane checks in under its own name, so a lane that dies is visible in
 * GET /api/jobs instead of being covered for by its neighbour still polling.

  // right for `chatgpt.ask` the moment the machine had three signed-in accounts.
  // The ask job is pinned in its plist precisely so it does not inherit the scan
  // daemon's WORKER_TYPES from ~/.gmap-worker.env, so unpinning it is not an
  // option -- it has to widen in place.
  //
  // One lane per signed-in ChatGPT account, and AGY_LANES of agy's OWN beside
  // them. agy does not ride an account's lane: a lane is serial, so an agy call
  // sitting on one is an idle ChatGPT account for as long as it runs -- and an
  // agy deep-research round runs for three to five minutes while a ChatGPT audit
  // runs for twenty seconds. agy needs no session; it is a CLI, not a browser
  // profile, which is exactly why it can have lanes of its own for free.
  //
  // agy used to be pinned to the first lane alone, on the reasoning that it is
  // one CLI against one credential and three claim loops would just race the
  // same binary. That was never measured, and the single lane is what made it
  // unmeasurable: 96 agy runs in ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/log, not one
  // concurrent pair among them. Measured on 24 Aug: three `agy -p` at once
  // answered in 7s/9s/12s against a 9s solo baseline, three correct distinct
  // answers, ~170MB RSS each on a 16GB box. There is no race. agy is a Go
  // binary spawned fresh per call, with a presence lock, a conversation
  // directory and a log file PER INSTANCE and no global lock anywhere.
  //
  // What the one lane cost: Round 04 of a company report is an agy call, and so
  // is the first act of the auto-VIP brief the same report kicks off ~30ms
  // earlier. On one lane the parent's own synthesis queues behind its child,
  // every time. Measured on report 2rO7nzyANyjYDpfOf0mQ: 306 seconds of a
  // 13m38s run spent with nothing running at all.
  //
  // Two, not three. The ceiling here is not the binary, it is that all of them
  // are one Google account -- three lanes is 3x the request rate against one
  // personal Antigravity credential, and a rate-limit refusal is a FAILED round
  // rather than a slow one. Two clears the parent/child collision, which is the
